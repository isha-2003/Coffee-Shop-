# Udacity-Coffee-Shop-App
 
 Please refer to the README file in the starter_code folder for details on running the app. 
 
 In this app, I used Oauth to create users and roles.  Managers could view menus and create new drinks.  Servers could just view the menu.  This required work with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and working with an external server (Oauth) and so an understanding of how to program with CORS.
